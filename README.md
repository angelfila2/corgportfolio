# Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built to introduce myself as an aspiring backend developer and to showcase my skills, learning journey, and growth as a software engineer.

The site is developed using React.js and Tailwind CSS, with additional icons from the Devcon lib.

# Purpose & Vision

The goal of this portfolio is to present a professional yet welcoming online presence—one that reflects both my technical abilities and my personality. I aimed to keep the design clean and modern while ensuring it feels approachable and easy to navigate.

# Thought Process

I intentionally designed the site to be simple and focused, allowing the content to highlight my fundamentals in frontend development while supporting my primary interest in backend engineering.

The site emphasizes:

- Clear structure and readability

- Responsive layouts across mobile and desktop

- Clean, maintainable React components

- Thoughtful use of Tailwind CSS for UI consistency

# Design & Development Process

To plan the layout and structure of the website, I first used Vercel v0 to generate an initial wireframe and visual reference. This helped me quickly explore layout ideas and page composition before writing any code.

Instead of using the generated output directly, I treated the wireframe as a design guide only. All components were implemented manually from scratch using React and Tailwind CSS.

This allowed me to:

- Translate visual designs into reusable React components
- Make deliberate UI and layout decisions
- Improve my understanding of responsive design and spacing
- Maintain full control over code quality and structure

Using Vercel v0 as a planning tool, while building the final implementation myself, allowed me to combine rapid ideation with hands-on development.

# Learning Journey & Growth

I began learning React.js in early December 2025 and completed this portfolio by the end of December 2025.

This project represents what I was able to achieve within one month of learning React, and serves as a practical demonstration of:

- My ability to learn new technologies quickly
- My habit of applying concepts through real projects
- My potential for continued growth with more time and experience

# Technologies Used

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)

# Closing Note

This portfolio reflects my recent transition into JavaScript-based development after graduating from university. While the site is intentionally minimal, it demonstrates my foundation in modern web development and my commitment to continuous improvement as a developer.
